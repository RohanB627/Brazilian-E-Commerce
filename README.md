# Freight Cost Optimization – Power BI Project

## Overview
This project analyses freight cost inefficiencies at the SKU and category level using Power BI.  
The goal is to identify **high-impact cost-reduction opportunities** and translate analytical insights into **clear, actionable recommendations**.

The dashboard is designed for commercial, operations, and finance stakeholders who need visibility into where freight costs are disproportionately eroding revenue.

---

## Business Problem
Freight costs often scale unevenly across products and categories.  
Without SKU-level diagnostics, organisations risk:
- Focusing cost-reduction efforts on low-impact areas  
- Missing a small set of SKUs driving outsized cost pressure  
- Applying broad cost controls with limited ROI  

This project focuses on **prioritisation**, not just reporting.

---

## Analytical Approach
The analysis follows a structured, decision-oriented flow:

1. Identify **material SKUs** based on revenue contribution  
2. Measure **freight cost as a percentage of revenue**  
3. Segment SKUs by **order volume, cost pressure, and revenue impact**  
4. Highlight **priority SKUs** exceeding defined cost thresholds  
5. Translate insights into **SKU-level cost-reduction actions**

---

## Key Features
- Priority SKU identification using freight % thresholds, order volume, and revenue impact  
- Cost-vs-scale analysis (freight % vs order volume, bubble size = revenue)  
- Category-level diagnostics to surface structural cost inefficiencies  
- Executive KPIs summarising freight exposure and priority impact  
- Action-oriented outputs linking analysis to business decisions

## Dashboard Structure
1. **Executive Overview**  
   High-level KPIs summarising freight exposure and priority SKUs  

2. **Root-Cause Analysis**  
   SKU- and category-level drivers of elevated freight costs  

3. **SKU-Level Cost Reduction Actions**  
   Prioritised SKUs with recommended actions such as:
   - Logistics renegotiation  
   - Pricing adjustments  
   - Assortment or packaging optimisation  

---

## Key Insight
A small subset of high-revenue SKUs and specific product categories account for a disproportionate share of freight cost pressure.  
Targeted, SKU-level interventions offer significantly higher impact than broad, untargeted cost-cutting measures.
